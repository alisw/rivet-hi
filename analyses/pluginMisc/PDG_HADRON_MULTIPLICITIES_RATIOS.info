Description:
  Ratios (w.r.t. $\pi^+/\pi^-$) of hadron multiplicities in hadronic $e^+ e^-$
  events, taken from Review of Particle Properties 2008, table 40.1,
  page 355.  Average hadron multiplicities per hadronic $e^+ e^-$
  annihilation event at $\sqrt{s} \approx$ 10, 29--35, 91, and
  130--200 GeV, normalised to the pion multiplicity. The numbers are averages
  from various experiments. Correlations of the systematic uncertainties
  were considered for the calculation of the averages.
