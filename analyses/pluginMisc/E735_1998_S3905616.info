RunInfo: QCD events, diffractive processes need to be switched
  on in order to fill the low multiplicity regions. The measurement was done in
  $|\eta| \lesssim 3.25$ and was extrapolated to full phase space. However, the method of
  extrapolation remains unclear.

Description:
  A measurement of the charged multiplicity distribution at $\sqrt{s} = 1.8\;\TeV$. The
  analysis is reproduced to the best of abilities. There is no theory curve in the paper
  to compare to.
