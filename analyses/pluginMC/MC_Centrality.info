Description:
   Template analysis for using CentralityBinner for dynamically
   determining centrality intervals using summed eT in the forward
   region.  The reference data is from an ATLAS paper on charged
   pseudo-rapidity distributions in different centrality bins in pPb
   at 5.03 TeV. The pseudo-rapidity distributions are corrected for
   detector effects, however, the distribution in the forward sum Et
   used for the centrality determination is not corrected.
   The pseudo-rapidity distributions are done in centrality bins
   according to the generated sum Et, according to the bins in sum
   Et obtained from the measurement, and the generators estimate of
   the centrality.
