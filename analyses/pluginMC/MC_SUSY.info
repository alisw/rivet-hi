Name: MC_SUSY
Summary: Validate generic SUSY events, including various lepton invariant mass
Description:
  Analysis of generic SUSY events at the LHC, based on Atlas Herwig++
  validation analysis contents. Plotted are $\eta$, $\phi$ and $\pT$ observables
  for charged tracks, photons, isolated photons, electrons, muons, and jets,
  as well as various dilepton mass `edge' plots for different event selection
  criteria.
RunInfo: SUSY events at any energy. $\pT$ cutoff at 10 GeV may be advised.
Status: VALIDATED
