Name: MC_LEADJETUE
Summary: Underlying event in leading jet events, extended to LHC
Status: VALIDATED
Authors:
 - Andy Buckley <andy.buckley@cern.ch>
RunInfo:
  LHC pp QCD interactions at 0.9, 10 or 14 TeV. Particles with
  $c \tau > 10$ mm should be set stable. Several $p_\perp^\text{min}$
  cutoffs are probably required to fill the profile histograms.

Description:
  Rick Field's measurement of the underlying event in leading jet
  events, extended to the LHC. As usual, the leading jet of the defines
  an azimuthal toward/transverse/away decomposition, in this case the
  event is accepted within $|\eta| < 2$, as in the CDF 2008 version of
  the analysis. Since this isn't the Tevatron, I've chosen to use
  $k_\perp$ rather than midpoint jets.
