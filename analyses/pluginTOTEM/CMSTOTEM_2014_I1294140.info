Description: 
   'The pseudorapidity distribution of charged particles produced in proton-proton collisions 
   at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV are measured in the ranges $|\eta| < 2.2$ and 
   $5.3 < |\eta| < 6.4$, with the CMS and TOTEM detectors, respectively. The measurement is
   performed with a one-side TOTEM trigger, which is sensitive to 99\% of non-diffractive
   interactions and diffractive interactions with masses above 3.6 GeV, for three different
   event selections. An inclusive sample with the least selection bias, a sample enhanced
   in non-single diffractive events, and a sample enhanced in single-diffractive events were 
   selected.'
