Description: Measurements of the mean charged multiplicities separately for $b\bar b$,
  $c\bar{c}$ and light quark ($uds$) initiated events in $e^+e^-$ interactions at energies
  above the $Z^0$ mass. In addition to the energy points in the original paper
  one additional point at 206;GeV is included from a later preliminary result.
