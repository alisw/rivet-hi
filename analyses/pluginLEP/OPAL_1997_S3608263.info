Description:  The $K^{*0}$ fragmentation function has been measured in hadronic $Z^0$ decays. 
 In addition the  helicity density matrix elements for inclusive $K^*(892)^0$ mesons
 from hadronic $Z^0$ decays have been measured over the full range of $K^{*0}$ momentum
 using data taken with the OPAL experiment at LEP. Only the fragmentation function
 measurement is currently implemented.
