Description:
  Measurement of the $b$-quark fragmentation function by DELPHI using 1994
  LEP 1 data. The fragmentation function for both weakly decaying and
  primary $b$-quarks has been determined in a model independent way.
  Nevertheless the authors trust $f(x_B^\text{weak})$ more than
  $f(x_B^\text{prim})$. Note --- this analysis is superseded by
  DELPHI_2011_I890503.
