Description:
  Jet rates, event-shape variables and inclusive charged particle spectra are
  measured in $e^+ e^-$ collisions at CMS energies between 91 and 209 GeV.
  The previously published data at 91.2 GeV and 133 GeV have been re-processed
  and the higher energy data are presented here for the first time.
  Note that the data have been corrected to include neutrinos.
