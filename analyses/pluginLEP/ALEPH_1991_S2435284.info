Description:
  The charged particle multiplicity distribution of hadronic Z decays,
  as measured on the peak of the Z resonance using the ALEPH detector at
  LEP. The unfolding procedure was model independent, and the
  distribution was found to have a mean of $20.85 \pm 0.24$, Comparison with
  lower energy data supports the KNO scaling hypothesis. The shape of
  the multiplicity distribution is well described by a log-normal
  distribution, as predicted from a cascading model for multi-particle
  production.
