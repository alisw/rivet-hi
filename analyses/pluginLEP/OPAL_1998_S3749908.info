Description: The inclusive production rates and differential cross sections of photons
   and mesons with a final state containing photons have been measured with the OPAL
   detector at LEP. The light mesons covered by the measurements are the $\pi^0$, $\eta$,
   $\rho(770)^\pm$, $\omega(782)$, $\eta'(958)$ and $a_0(980)^\pm$.
