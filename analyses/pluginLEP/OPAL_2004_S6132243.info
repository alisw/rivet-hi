RunInfo:
  Hadronic $e^+ e^-$ events at 4 representative energies (91, 133, 177, 197).
  Runs need to have ISR suppressed, since the analysis was done using a cut of
  $\sqrt{s} - \sqrt{s_\text{reco}} < 1\,\text{GeV}$. Particles with a livetime
  $> 3 \cdot 10^{-10}\,\text{s}$ are considered to be stable.

Description:
  Measurement of $e^+ e^-$ event shape variable distributions and their 1st 
  to 5th moments in LEP running from the Z pole to the highest LEP 2 energy
  of 209 GeV.
