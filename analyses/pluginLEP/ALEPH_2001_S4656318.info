Description:
  Measurement of the $b$-quark fragmentation function by ALEPH using
  LEP 1 data. The fragmentation function for both weakly decaying and
  leading $b$-quarks has been determined. The data used for the plots has
  been renormalised to give a differential distribution rather than the bin-by-bin
  average in HEPDATA.
