RunInfo:
  Hadronic Z decay events generated on the Z pole ($\sqrt{s} = 91.2$ GeV)
  Hadronisation should be turned off because the data is corrected back to the
  parton level.

Description:
  'Angles between the leading (in energy) four jets defined using the Durham
  algorithm with $y_\mathrm{cut}=0.008$. The data is presented at the parton
  level and includes the Bengtsson-Zerwas, Korner-Schierholz-Willrodt and
  Nachtmann-Reiter angles as well as the angle between the two softest jets.'

ToDo:
 - Add y23 and R4(ycut) histograms
 - Get data from HepData when available (so far just read off the plots)
