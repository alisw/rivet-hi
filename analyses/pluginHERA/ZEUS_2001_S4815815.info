Description:
  ZEUS photoproduction of jets from proton--positron collisions at beam
  energies of 820~GeV on 27.5~GeV. Photoproduction can either be direct,
  in which case the photon interacts directly with the parton, or
  resolved, in which case the photon acts as a source of quarks and
  gluons. A photon-proton centre of mass energy of between 134~GeV and
  227~GeV is probed, with values of $x_P$, the fractional momentum of the
  partons inside the proton, predominantly in the region between 0.01
  and 0.1. The fractional momentum of the partons from the photon,
  $x_\gamma$, is in the region 0.1 to 1. Jets are reconstructed in the
  range $-1 < |\eta| < 2.4$ using the $k_\perp$ algorithm with an $R$
  parameter of 1.0. The minimum \pT of the leading jet should be greater
  than 14~GeV, and at least one other jet must have $\pT > 11$~GeV.
