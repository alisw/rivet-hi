Description:
  Global properties of the hadronic final state in deep inelastic
  scattering events at HERA are investigated. The data are corrected for
  detector effects. Energy flows in both the laboratory frame and the
  hadronic centre of mass system, and energy-energy correlations in the
  laboratory frame are presented.  Historically, the Ariadne colour
  dipole model provided the only satisfactory description of this data,
  hence making it a useful 'target' analysis for MC shower models.
