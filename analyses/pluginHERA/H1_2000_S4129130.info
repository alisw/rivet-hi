Description:
  Measurements of transverse energy flow for neutral current deep-
  inelastic scattering events produced in positron-proton collisions at
  HERA. The kinematic range covers squared momentum transfers $Q^2$ from
  3.2 to 2200 GeV$^2$; the Bjorken scaling variable $x$ from $8 \times 10^{-5}$ to
  0.11 and the hadronic mass $W$ from 66 to 233 GeV. The transverse
  energy flow is measured in the hadronic centre of mass frame and is
  studied as a function of $Q^2$, $x$, $W$ and pseudorapidity. The
  behaviour of the mean transverse energy in the central pseudorapidity
  region and an interval corresponding to the photon fragmentation
  region are analysed as a function of $Q^2$ and $W$.  This analysis is
  useful for exploring the effect of photon PDFs and for tuning models
  of parton evolution and treatment of fragmentation and the proton
  remnant in DIS.
