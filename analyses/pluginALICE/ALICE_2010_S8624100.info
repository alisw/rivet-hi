Description:
  'This is an ALICE analysis where charged particle multiplicities (including
   the zero bin) have been measured in three different pseudorapidity intervals
   ($|\eta|<0.5; |\eta|<1.0; |\eta|<1.3$. Only the INEL distributions have
   been considered here, i.e. this analysis can only be meaningfully compared to
   PYTHIA 6 with diffractive processes disabled. The data were taken at 900 and
   2360\;GeV.'
