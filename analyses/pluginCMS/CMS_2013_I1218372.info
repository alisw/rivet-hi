Description:
  'Ratio of the energy deposited in the  pseudorapidity range $-6.6 < \eta < -5.2$
   for events with a charged particle jet with $|\eta|<2$ with respect to the
   energy in  inclusive events, as a function of charged particle jet transverse
   momentum for $\sqrt{s}=$0.9, 2.76 and 7 TeV.'
