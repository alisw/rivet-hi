Description:
  Double parton scattering is investigated in proton-proton collisions
  at $\sqrt{s} = 7$~TeV where the final state includes a $W$ boson, which
  decays into a muon and a neutrino, and two jets. The data sample
  corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 5 inverse femtobarns,
  collected with the CMS detector at the LHC.
