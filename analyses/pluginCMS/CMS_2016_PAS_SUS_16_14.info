Description:
  'A search for supersymmetry in all-hadronic events with large missing transverse
  momentum, produced in proton--proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13~\TeV$. The data
  sample, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 12.9/fb, was collected with
  the CMS detector at the CERN LHC in 2016. The data are examined in search regions
  of jet multiplicity, tagged bottom quark jet multiplicity, missing transverse momentum,
  and the scalar sum of jet transverse momenta. The observed numbers of events in all
  search regions are found to be consistent with the expectations from standard model
  processes.'
