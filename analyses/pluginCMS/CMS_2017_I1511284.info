Description:
  'The differential cross section for inclusive particle production as a
   function of energy in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13
   TeV is measured in the very forward region of the CMS detector. The measurement
   is based on data collected with the CMS apparatus at the LHC, and corresponds to
   an integrated luminosity of 0.35 inverse microbarns. The energy is measured in
   the CASTOR calorimeter, which covers the pseudorapidity region
   $-6.6 < \eta < -5.2$. The results are given as a function of the total energy deposited
   in CASTOR, as well as of its electromagnetic and hadronic components. The
   spectra are sensitive to the modeling of multiparton interactions in pp
   collisions, and provide new constraints for hadronic interaction models used in
   collider and in high energy cosmic ray physics.'
