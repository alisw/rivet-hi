Description:
    'Jet multiplicity distributions in top quark pair ($t\bar{t}$) events are measured in $pp$
     collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8\;\TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC, using
     a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7/fb. The measurement is
     performed in the dilepton decay channels $e^+e^-$, $\mu^+\mu^-$, and $e^\pm\mu^\mp$).
     The absolute and normalized differential cross-sections for $t\bar{t}$ production are
     measured as a function of jet multiplicity for different jet transverse momentum thresholds
     and the kinematic properties of the leading additional jets. The differential $t\bar{t}b$
     and $t\bar{t}b\bar{b}$ cross-sections are presented for the first time as a function of
     the kinematic properties of the leading additional $b$-jets. Furthermore, the fraction of
     events without additional jets above a threshold is measured as a function of the transverse
     momenta of the leading additional jets and the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of all
     additional jets.'
