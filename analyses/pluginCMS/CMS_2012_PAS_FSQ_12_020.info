Description:
  'We study charged particle production in proton--proton collisions at 7 TeV. We use the direction
  of the charged particle with the largest transverse momentum in each event to define three
  regions of $\eta$--$\phi$ space: toward, away, and transverse. The average number and the
  average scalar pT sum of charged particles in the transverse region are sensitive to the
  modeling of the underlying event. The transverse region is divided into a MAX and MIN transverse
  region, which helps separate the hard component (initial and final-state radiation) from the
  beam--beam remnant and multiple parton interaction components of the scattering.'
