RunInfo:
  Drell-Yan events with an electron or muon final state are necessary. High
  statistics as well as a NLO generator are recommended for a good agreement

Description:
  'This analysis measures the forward-backward asymmetry $A_{FB}$ in Drell-Yan
  events at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. Both the individual and combined
  electron and muon pair channels are analyzed. In four rapidity regions,
  $A_{FB}$ is given as a function of the lepton mass. The data, recorded with the
  CMS detector, corresponds to an integrated luminosity of
  $5\,\textrm{fb}^{-1}$.'
