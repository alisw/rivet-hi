Description:
   A measurement of the underlying event activity using Drell-Yan events using
   muonic final state.  The production of charged particles with pseudorapidity
   $|\eta| < 2$ and transverse momentum $p_\perp > 0.5\,\GeV/c$ is studied in towards,
   transverse and away region w.r.t. to the direction of di-muon system. The UE
   activity is measured in terms of of a particle density and an energy
   density. The particle density is computed as the average number of primary
   charged particles per unit pseudorapidity and per unit azimuth. The energy
   density is expressed in terms of the average of the scalar sum of the
   transverse momenta of primary charged particles per unit pseudorapidity and
   azimuth.  The ratio of the energy and particle density is also reported in 3
   regions.  UE activity  is studied as a function of invariant mass of muon
   pair ($M_{\mu\mu}$) by limiting the ISR contribution by requiring transverse
   momentum of muon pair $p_\perp(\mu\mu) < 5\,\GeV/c$. The $p_\perp(\mu\mu)$
   dependence is studied for the events having $M_{\mu\mu}$ in window of
   81--101 GeV/$c$. The normalized charged particle multiplicity and $p_\perp$
   spectrum of the charged particles in three regions also been reported for
   events having $M_{\mu\mu}$ in window of 81--101 GeV/$c$. Multiplicity and $p_\perp$
   spectra in the transverse region are also reported, for events having
   $p_\perp(\mu\mu) < 5\,\GeV/c$.
