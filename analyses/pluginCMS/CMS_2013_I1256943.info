RunInfo:
  '$pp$ collisions with $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV. Selection of events with exactly two
  $b$-hadrons and a lepton pair from the $Z$ boson decay. Each lepton has $p_T > 20$ GeV
  and $|\eta| < 2.4$ and the dilepton invariant mass is $81 < M_{\ell\ell} < 101$ GeV. The
  $b$-hadrons have $p_T > 15$ GeV and $|\eta| < 2$. The differential cross sections
  are measured for $p_T > 0$ and $p_T > 50$ GeV.'

Description:
  'A study of proton-proton collisions in which two $b$-hadrons
  are produced in association with a $Z$ boson is reported. The
  collisions were recorded at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV
  with the CMS detector at the LHC, for an integrated luminosity
  of 5.2/fb. The $b$-hadrons are identified by means of
  displaced secondary vertices, without the use of reconstructed jets,
  permitting the study of $b$-hadron pair production at small angular
  separation. Differential cross sections are presented as a function
  of the angular separation of the $b$-hadrons and the $Z$ boson.
  In addition, inclusive measurements are presented. For both the
  inclusive and differential studies,different ranges of $Z$ boson
  momentum are considered.'
