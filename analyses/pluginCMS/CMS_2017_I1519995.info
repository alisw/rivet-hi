Description:
  'Dijet angular distributions are measured in proton-proton collisions at
  $\sqrt{s}=13~\TeV$, using a data set corresponding to an integrated
  luminosity of 2.6/fb collected by the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. Dijet
  angular distributions are found to be in agreement with the perturbative QCD
  predictions that include electroweak corrections.'
