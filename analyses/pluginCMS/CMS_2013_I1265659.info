Description:
  A study of color coherence effects in $pp$ collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV
  is presented. The data used in the analysis were collected in 2010 with the CMS detector
  at the LHC and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 36/pb. Events are
  selected that contain at least three jets and where the two jets with the largest transverse
  momentum exhibit a back-to-back topology. The measured angular correlation
  between the second- and third-leading jet is shown to be sensitive to color coherence
  effects, and is compared to the predictions of Monte Carlo models with various implementations
  of color coherence. None of the models describe the data satisfactorily.
