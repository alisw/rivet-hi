Description:
  A measurement of the ratio of the inclusive 3-jet to 2-jet cross sections as a function of the total jet
  transverse momentum, $H_T$, in the range $0.2 < H_T < 2.5$ TeV is presented. The data have been collected
  at a proton--proton centre-of-mass energy of 7\;TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC, and correspond
  to an integrated luminosity of 36/pb.
  Jets are anti-$k_t$ with $R = 0.5$, $p_\perp > 50\;\GeV$ and $|\eta| < 2.5$.
