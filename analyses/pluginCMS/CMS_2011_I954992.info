Description:
   'A measurement of the exclusive two-photon production of muon pairs in
    proton-proton collisions at at a centre-of-mass energy 7 TeV with the final
    state $p \mu^+ \mu^- p$, is reported using data corresponding to an
    integrated luminosity of 40 pb$^-1$ collected in 2010.  The measured cross
    section is obtained with a fit to the dimuon $p_T$ distribution for muon
    pairs with invariant mass greater than 11.5 GeV with each muon $p_T > 4$
    GeV and $|\eta| < 2.1$.'
