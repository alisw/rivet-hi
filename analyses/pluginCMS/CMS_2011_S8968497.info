Description:
   Measurement of dijet angular distributions in proton-proton collisions at a
   center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. The data sample, collected with single jet
   triggers, has a total integrated luminosity of 36 pb$^{-1}$, with jets being
   reconstructed using the anti-$k_t$ clustering algorithm with $R=0.5$. The data
   are presented for the variable $\chi$ defined as $\chi = \exp(|y_1 - y_2|)$
   where $y_1$ and $y_2$ are the rapidities of the two leading (highest $\pT$) jets.'
