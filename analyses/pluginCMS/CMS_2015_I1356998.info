Description:
    'Measurements of diffractive dissociation cross sections in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=7$~TeV are presented 
    in kinematic regions defined by the masses $M_{\mathrm{X}}$ and $M_{\mathrm{Y}}$ of the two final-state hadronic 
    systems separated by the largest rapidity gap in the event. Differential cross sections are measured as a function 
    of $\xi_{\mathrm{X}}= M^2_{\mathrm{X}}/s$ in the region $-5.5<\log_{10}\xi_{\mathrm{X}}<-2.5$, for $\log_{10}M_{\mathrm{Y}}<0.5$, 
    dominated by single dissociation (SD), and $0.5<\log_{10}M_{\mathrm{Y}}<1.1$, dominated by double dissociation (DD), 
    where $M_{\mathrm{X}}$ and $M_{\mathrm{Y}}$ are given in GeV. The inclusive pp cross section is also measured as a function 
    of the width of the central pseudorapidity gap $\Delta\eta$ for $\Delta\eta>3$, $\log_{10}M_{\mathrm{X}}>1.1$, 
    and $\log_{10}M_{\mathrm{Y}}>1.1$, a region dominated by DD. The cross sections integrated over these regions are 
    used to extract the total SD and DD cross sections. In addition, the inclusive differential cross section, 
    $\mathrm{d}\sigma / \mathrm{d}\Delta\eta^\mathrm{F}$, for events with a pseudorapidity gap adjacent to the edge of 
    the detector, is measured over $\Delta\eta^\mathrm{F}$ = 8.4 units of pseudorapidity. The results are compared to 
    those of other experiments and to theoretical predictions, and found compatible with slowly-rising diffractive cross 
    sections as a function of center-of-mass energy.'
