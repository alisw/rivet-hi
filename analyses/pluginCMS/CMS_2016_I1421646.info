Description:
 'A measurement of the decorrelation of azimuthal angles between the two jets with the
 largest transverse momenta is presented for seven regions of leading jet transverse
 momentum up to 2.2 TeV. The analysis is based on the proton-proton collision data
 collected with the CMS experiment at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV corresponding
 to an integrated luminosity of 19.7/fb. The dijet azimuthal decorrelation is caused by
 the radiation of additional jets and probes the dynamics of multijet production. The
 results are compared to fixed-order predictions of perturbative quantum chromodynamics
 (QCD), and to simulations using Monte Carlo event generators that include parton showers,
 hadronization, and multiparton interactions.  Event generators with only two outgoing
 high transverse momentum partons fail to describe the measurement, even when supplemented
 with next-to-leading-order QCD corrections and parton showers. Much better agreement
 is achieved when at least three outgoing partons are complemented through either
 next-to-leading-order predictions or parton showers.  This observation emphasizes
 the need to improve predictions for multijet production.'
