Description:
  'Characteristics of multi-particle production in proton-proton
  collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV are studied as a function of the
  charged-particle multiplicity ($N_{ch}$). The produced particles are separated
  into two classes: those belonging to jets and those belonging to the
  underlying event. Charged particles are measured with pseudorapidity
  $|\eta| < 2.4$ and transverse momentum $p_T > 0.25$ GeV. Jets are
  reconstructed from charged-particles only and required to have
  $\pt > 5$ GeV. The distributions of jet \pt, average \pt of charged particles
  belonging to the underlying event or to jets, jet rates, and jet shapes
  are presented as functions of $N_{ch}$.'
