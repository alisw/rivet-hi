Description:
  'A search for supersymmetry based on multijet events with large missing transverse
  momentum produced in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}
  = 13\,\TeV$. The data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9/fb, were
  collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC in 2016. The analysis utilizes
  four-dimensional exclusive search regions defined in terms of the number of jets,
  the number of tagged bottom quark jets, the scalar sum of jet transverse momenta,
  and the magnitude of the vector sum of jet transverse momenta. This coding presents
  the fully detailed 174 signal regions, as well as 12 aggregate signal regions.'
