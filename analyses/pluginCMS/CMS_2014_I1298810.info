RunInfo:
 Hard QCD events with $\hat{p}_{\text{T}} > 40\,\text{GeV}$ at $\sqrt{s} = 7\,\text{TeV}$.
 Either a $\hat{p}_{\text{T}}$-binned approach or a 'flat' spectrum is recommended, to
 generate sufficient events in the high $p_{\text{T}}$ region.

Description:
  'Ratios of jet transverse momentum spectra. The jets objects are defined
  using the anti-$k_{\text{T}}$ algorithm with radii of R = 0.5 and R = 0.7. The
  ratios are given for six 0.5 wide rapidity regions ranging from 0.0 to 3.0 and
  relate the ratio of inclusive, differential jet cross sections.'
