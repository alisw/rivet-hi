Description:
  'An inclusive search for supersymmetric processes that produce final states with jets
   and missing transverse energy in $pp$ collisions at 8\;\TeV. The data sample corresponds
   to an integrated luminosity of 11.7/fb collected by the CMS experiment. In this search,
   a dimensionless kinematic variable, $\alpha_T$, is used to discriminate between events
   with genuine and misreconstructed missing transverse energy. The search was based on
   an examination of the number of reconstructed jets per event, the scalar sum of
   transverse energies of these jets, and the number of these jets identified as originating
   from bottom quarks. No significant excess of events over the standard model expectation
   was found.'
