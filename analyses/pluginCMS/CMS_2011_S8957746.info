Description:
   Central transverse Thrust and Minor have been measured in proton-proton
   collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV, with a data sample collected with the CMS
   detector at the LHC. The sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of
   3.2 inverse picobarns.
   Input for the variables are anti-$k_t$ jets with $R = 0.5$.
