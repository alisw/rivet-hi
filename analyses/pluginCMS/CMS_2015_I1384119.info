Description:
  'The pseudorapidity distribution of charged hadrons in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} =13$ TeV is
   measured using a data sample obtained with the CMS detector, operated at zero magnetic field,
   at the CERN LHC. The yield of primary charged long-lived hadrons produced in inelastic $pp$
   collisions is determined in the central region of the CMS pixel detector ($|eta| < 2$) using
   both hit pairs and reconstructed tracks.'
