Description:
  'Differential and integrated jet rates for Durham and JADE jet algorithms.

  The integration cut value used for the integrated rate observables is not
  well-defined in the paper: the midpoint of the differential bin has been used
  thanks to information from Stefan Kluth and Christoph Pahl.  We anyway
  recommend that the differential plots be preferred over the integrated ones
  for MC generator validation and tuning, to minimise correlations.'
