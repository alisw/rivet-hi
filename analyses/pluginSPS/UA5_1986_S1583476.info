Description:
  This study comprises measurements of pseudorapidity distributions measured with the UA5
  detector at 200 and 900 GeV center of momentum energy. There are distributions for
  non-single diffractive (NSD) events and also for the combination of single- and double-diffractive
  events. The NSD distributions are further studied for certain ranges of the events charged
  multiplicity.
