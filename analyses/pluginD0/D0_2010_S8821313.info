Description:
  Using 7.3 pb$^{-1}$ the distribution of the variable $\phi^*$ is measured, which
  probes the same physical effects as the $Z/\gamma^*$ boson transverse
  momentum, but is less susceptible to the effects of experimental resolution
  and efficiency. Results are presented for both the di-electron and di-muon
  channel.
