RunInfo:
  $p \bar{p} \to \mu^+ \mu^-$ + jets at 1960~GeV.
  Needs mass cut on lepton pair to avoid photon singularity,
  looser than $65 < m_{\mu\mu} < 115$ GeV.
  Restrict $Z/\gamma^*$ mass range to roughly $50~\text{GeV}/c^2 < m_{\mu\mu}
    < 120~\text{GeV}/c^2$ for efficiency.
  Weighted events and kinematic sampling enhancement can help to fill the pT tail.

Description:
  Cross section as a function of pT of the Z boson decaying into muons
  in $p \bar{p}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 1.96
  TeV, based on an integrated luminosity of 0.97 fb$^{-1}$.
