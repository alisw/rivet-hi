Description:
  WARNING! Mark as "STAR preliminary" and contact authors when using this!
  UE analysis similar to Rick Field's leading jet analysis. SIScone with
  radius/resolution parameter R=0.7 is used. Particles with $pT > 0.2~\text{GeV}$
  and $|\eta| < 1$ are included in the analysis. All particles are assumed
  to have zero mass. Only jets with neutral energy $< 0.7$ are included.
  For the transMIN and transMAX $\Delta(\phi)$ is between $\pi/3$ and $2\pi/3$, and
  $\Delta(\eta) < 2.0$. For the jet region the area of the jet is used for the
  normalization, i.e. the scaling factor is $\pi R^2$ and not
  $\mathrm{d}\phi\mathrm{d}\eta$ (this is different from what Rick Field does!).
  The tracking efficiency is $\sim 0.8$, but that is an approximation,
  as below $pT \sim 0.6~\text{GeV}$ it is falling quite steeply.
