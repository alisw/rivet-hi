Description:
  'The measurement of the flavour composition of dijet events produced
   in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=7\;\TeV$ using the ATLAS detector.
   Six possible combinations of light, charm and bottom jets are identified
   in the dijet events, where the jet flavour is defined by the presence
   of bottom, charm or solely light flavour hadrons in the jet.
   The fractions of these dijet flavour states as functions of the leading
   jet transverse momentum in the range 40 GeV to 500 GeV and jet
   rapidity $|y| < 2.1$ are measured.'
