Description:
  'This Letter presents the measurement of differential cross sections of isolated prompt photons produced in association with a
  $b$-jet or a $c$-jet. These final states provide sensitivity to the heavy-flavour content of the proton and aspects related to the
  modelling of heavy-flavour quarks in perturbative QCD. The measurement uses proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass
  energy of 8 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2012 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of up to 20.2 fb$^{-1}$.
  The differential cross sections are measured for each jet flavour with respect to the transverse energy of the leading photon in
  two photon pseudorapidity regions: $|\eta^\gamma| < 1.37$ and $1.56 < |\eta^\gamma| < 2.37$. The measurement covers photon transverse
  energies $25 < E^\gamma_\text{T} < 400$ GeV and $25 < E^\gamma_\text{T} < 350$ GeV respectively for the two $|\eta^\gamma|$ regions.
  For each jet flavour, the ratio of the cross sections in the two $|\eta^\gamma|$ regions is also measured. The measurement is corrected 
  for detector effects and compared to leading-order and next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculations, based on various treatments 
  and assumptions about the heavy-flavour content of the proton. Overall, the predictions agree well with the measurement, but some 
  deviations are observed at high photon transverse energies. The total uncertainty in the measurement ranges between 13% and 66%, 
  while the central $\gamma + b$ measurement exhibits the smallest uncertainty, ranging from 13% to 27%, which is comparable to the 
  precision of the theoretical predictions.'
