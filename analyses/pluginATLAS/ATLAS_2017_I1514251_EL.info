Description:
  'Measurements of the production cross section of a $Z$ boson in association with jets in proton-proton collisions at i
  $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV are presented, using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.16 fb${}^{-1}$ collected by
  the ATLAS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider in 2015. Inclusive and differential cross sections are measured
  for events containing a $Z$ boson decaying to electrons or muons and produced in association with up to seven jets with
  $p_\text{T}>30$ GeV and $|y|<2.5$. Predictions from different Monte Carlo generators based on leading-order and
  next-to-leading-order matrix elements for up to two additional partons interfaced with parton shower and fixed-order
  predictions at next-to-leading order and next-to-next-to-leading order are compared with the measured cross sections.
  Good agreement within the uncertainties is observed for most of the modelled quantities, in particular with the generators
  which use next-to-leading-order matrix elements and the more recent next-to-next-to-leading-order fixed-order predictions.'
