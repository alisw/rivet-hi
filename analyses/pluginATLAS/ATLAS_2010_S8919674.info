RunInfo:
  W+jets events ideally with matrix element corrections to describe the
  higher jet multiplicities correctly. Both channels, electron and muon,
  are part of this analysis and should be run simultaneously.

Description:
  'Cross sections, in both the electron and muon decay modes of the W boson,
   are presented as a function of jet multiplicity and of the transverse
   momentum of the leading and next-to-leading jets in the event.
   Measurements are also presented of the ratio of cross sections for inclusive
   jet multiplicities.
   The results, based on an integrated luminosity of 1.3 pb-1, have been
   corrected for all known detector effects and are quoted in a limited and
   well-defined range of jet and lepton kinematics.'

ToDo:
 - Implement jet multiplicity ratio plots.
 - Export original data file from HepForge.
