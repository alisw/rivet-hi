Description:
  'The production of $W$ boson pairs in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV is studied using data corresponding to 
  20.3 fb${}^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity collected by the ATLAS detector during 2012 at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The 
  $W$ bosons are reconstructed using their leptonic decays into electrons or muons and neutrinos. Events with reconstructed jets 
  are not included in the candidate event sample. A total of 6636 $WW$ candidate events are observed. Measurements are performed 
  in fiducial regions closely approximating the detector acceptance. The integrated measurement is corrected for all acceptance 
  effects and for the $W$ branching fractions to leptons in order to obtain the total $WW$ production cross section, which is found 
  to be $71.1 \pm 1.1$ (stat) ${}^{+5.7}_{-5.0}$ (syst) $\pm 1.4$ (lumi) pb. This agrees with the next-to-next-to-leading-order 
  Standard Model prediction of $63.2 {}^{+1.6}_{-1.4}$ (scale) $\pm 1.2$ (PDF) pb. Fiducial differential cross sections are 
  measured as a function of each of six kinematic variables. The distribution of the transverse momentum of the leading lepton 
  is used to set limits on anomalous triple-gauge-boson couplings.'
