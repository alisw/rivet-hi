Description:
  'A search for narrow resonances $m_X$ decaying into two photons in the
   mass range $65 < mX < 600$ GeV was performed using 20.3 inverse
   femtobarns of $pp$ collisions data collected by the ATLAS experiment at
   the Large Hadron Collider. The results are presented as a
   model-independent limit on the fiducial production cross-section of a
   scalar boson times branching ratio into two photons. This routine
   applies the fiducial cuts on the photons (kinematic cuts and isolation
   cuts) and computes the fiducial cross-section. The total cross-section
   times branching ratio to two photons must be given as input to the
   routine.'
