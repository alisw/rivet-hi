Description:
  'The Z pT at $\sqrt{s} = 7$\;TeV is measured using electron and muon $Z$ decay
  channels. The dressed leptons definition uses photons clustered in a cone around
  the charged leptons, while the bare lepton definition uses the post-FSR charged
  leptons only in the $Z$ reconstruction. The data used in the bare leptons calculation
  are based on a forward application of a PHOTOS-based energy loss correction and are
  hence not quite model-independent.'
