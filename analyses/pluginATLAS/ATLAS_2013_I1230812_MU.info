Description:
  'Measurements of the production of jets of particles in association with a Z
   boson in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV are presented, using data corresponding
   to an integrated luminosity of 4.6/fb collected by the ATLAS experiment at
   the Large Hadron Collider. Inclusive and differential jet cross sections in Z
   events, with Z decaying into electron or muon pairs, are measured for jets with
   transverse momentum $p_T > 30$ GeV and rapidity $|y| < 4.4$.

   This Rivet module implements the event selection for Z decaying into muons
   and uses the data measured explicitly in this channel (not the combined results
   shown in the paper plots). If you want to use electronic events, please refer to
   ATLAS\_2013\_I1230812\_EL.
