Description:
  'Measurements of jet activity in top-quark pair events produced in proton–proton collisions are presented, using 3.2 fb$^{-1}$
  of $pp$ collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider.
  Events are chosen by requiring an opposite-charge $e\mu$ pair and two $b$-tagged jets in the final state. The normalised differential
  cross-sections of top-quark pair production are presented as functions of additional-jet multiplicity and transverse momentum,
  $p_\text{T}$. The fraction of signal events that do not contain additional jet activity in a given rapidity region, the gap fraction,
  is measured as a function of the $p_\text{T}$ threshold for additional jets, and is also presented for different invariant mass regions
  of the $e\mu b\bar{b}$ system. All measurements are corrected for detector effects and presented as particle-level distributions
  compared to predictions with different theoretical approaches for QCD radiation. While the kinematics of the jets from top-quark
  decays are  described well, the generators show differing levels of agreement with the measurements of observables that depend
  on the production of additional jets.'
