Description:
   Double-differential three-jet production cross-sections have been measured in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of
   $\sqrt{s} = 7\,$TeV using the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The measurements are presented as a function of the
   three-jet mass ($m_{jjj}$), in bins of the sum of the absolute rapidity separations between the three leading jets
   ($\left|Y^\ast\right|$). Invariant masses extending up to 5\,TeV are reached for $8<\left|Y^\ast\right|<10$. These measurements use
   a sample of data recorded using the ATLAS detector in 2011, which corresponds to an integrated luminosity of
   $4.51\,\text{fb}^{-1}$. Jets are identified using the anti-$k_\text{t}$ algorithm with two different jet radius parameters,
   $R=0.4$ and $R=0.6$.
