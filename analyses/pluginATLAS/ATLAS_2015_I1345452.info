Description:
  'Various differential cross-sections are measured in top-quark pair
  ($t\bar{t}$) events produced in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass
  energy of $\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV at the LHC with the ATLAS detector. These
  differential cross-sections are presented in a data set corresponding to an
  integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb$^{-1}$. The differential cross-sections are
  presented in terms of kinematic variables of a top-quark proxy referred to as
  the pseudo-top-quark whose dependence on theoretical models is minimal. The
  pseudo-top-quark can be defined in terms of either reconstructed detector
  objects or stable particles in an analogous way. The measurements are
  performed on $t\bar{t}$ events in the lepton+jets channel, requiring exactly
  one charged lepton and at least four jets with at least two of them tagged as
  originating from a $b$-quark. The hadronic and leptonic pseudo-top-quarks are
  defined via the leptonic or hadronic decay mode of the W boson produced by
  the top-quark decay in events with a single charged lepton. The cross-section
  is measured as a function of the transverse momentum and rapidity of both the
  hadronic and leptonic pseudo-top-quark as well as the transverse momentum,
  rapidity and invariant mass of the pseudo-top-quark pair system. The
  measurements are corrected for detector effects and are presented within a
  kinematic range that closely matches the detector acceptance.'
