Description:
  'Search for supersymmmetric particles by ATLAS at 7 TeV in events with b-jets, large missing
  energy, and no leptons.
  Event counts in four signal regions (1 b-jet, $m_eff>500$\,GeV; 1 b-jet, $m_eff>700$\,GeV; 2 b-jets,
  $m_eff>500$\,GeV; 2 b-jets, $m_eff>700$\,GeV) are implemented as one-bin histograms.
  Histograms for missing transverse energy, effective mass, and pT of the leading jet are
  implemented for the 1 b-tag and 2 b-tag signal regions.'
