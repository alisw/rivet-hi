Description:
  'Search for SUSY using events with 6 or more jets in
   association with missing transverse momentum produced in proton-proton
   collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. The data sample has a total
   integrated luminosity of 1.34 fb$^{-1}$. Distributions
   in the $W$ and top control regions are not produced, while in addition to
   the plots from the paper the count of events in the different signal regions
   is included.'
