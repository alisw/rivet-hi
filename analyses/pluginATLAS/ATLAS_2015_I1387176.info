Description:
  High transverse momentum jets produced in $pp$ collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7\,TeV are used to measure the transverse
  energy-energy correlation function and its associated azimuthal asymmetry. The data were recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC
  in the year 2011 and correspond to an integrated luminosity of $158\,\text{pb}^{−1}$. The selection criteria demand the average 
  transverse  momentum of the two leading jets in an event to be larger than 250\,GeV. The data are unfolded to the particle level.
  NB--If the routine is to be run on several samples (with different cross sections), the asymmetry has to be calculated again in a
  post-processing step using the merged output file.
