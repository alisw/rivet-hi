Description:
  'Search for direct pair production of heavy top-quark partners with 4.7 fb$^{-1}$ integrated luminosity at $\sqrt{s} = 7 TeV$ by the ATLAS experiment. Heavy top-quark partners decaying into a top quark and a neutral non-interacting particle are searched for in events with two leptons in the final state.'
