Description:
  'A measurement of the splitting scales occuring in the $k_\text{t}$ jet-clustering algorithm is presented for final states containing
  a $Z$ boson. The measurement is done using 20.2 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data collected at a centre-of-mass energy of
  $\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC in 2012. The measurement is based on charged-particle track information,
  which is measured with excellent precision in the $p_\text{T}$ region relevant for the transition between the perturbative and the
  non-perturbative regimes. The data distributions are corrected for detector effects, and are found to deviate from
  state-of-the-art predictions in various regions of the observables.'
