Description:
  'A measurement is presented of the $\phi \rightarrow K^+K^-$ production cross section at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV using pp collision data
  corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 383 $\mu$b$^{-1}$ collected with the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. Selection of $\phi(1020)$
  mesons is based on the identification of charged kaons by their energy loss in the pixel detector. The differential cross section is
  measured as a function of the transverse momentum, $pT,\phi$, and rapidity, $y_\phi$, of the $\phi(1020)$ meson in the fiducial region
  500 < $pT,\phi$ < 1200 MeV, |$y_\phi$| < 0.8, kaon $pT,K$ > 230 MeV and kaon momentum $p_K$ < 800 MeV. The integrated $\phi(1020)$
  production cross section in this fiducial range is measured to be $\sigma_{\phi \rightarrow K^+K^-}$ = 570 \pm 8 (stat) \pm 66 (syst) \pm 20 (lumi) $\mu$b.'
