Description:
  'This note presents the measurement of inclusive-jet cross-sections in proton--proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13TeV.
  The measurement uses data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb$^{-1}$ collected with the ATLAS detector at the 
  Large Hadron Collider in 2015. Jets are clustered using the anti-$k_\text{t}$ algorithm with a radius parameter value of $R = 0.4$. 
  Double differential inclusive-jet cross-sections are presented as a function of the jet transverse momentum, covering the range from 
  100 GeV to about 3.2 TeV, and of the absolute jet rapidity, up to $|y| = 3$. The predictions of next-to-leading-order QCD calculations 
  using several parton distribution function (PDF) sets and corrected for non-perturbative and electroweak effects are compared to the 
  measured cross-sections. The predictions are consistent with the measured cross-sections within uncertainties.'
