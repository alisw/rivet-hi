Description:
  Measurement of the inclusive jet cross-section in proton--proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy
  of 7 TeV using a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.5/fb collected with the
  ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider in 2011. Jets are identified using the anti-$k_t$ algorithm
  with radius parameter values of 0.4 and 0.6. The double-differential cross-sections are presented
  as a function of the jet transverse momentum and the jet rapidity, covering jet transverse momenta
  from 100 GeV to 2 TeV.
