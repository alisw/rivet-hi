Description:
  'A measurement of the jet activity in rapidity intervals bounded by a dijet
  system. The fraction of events passing a veto requirement are shown as a
  function of both the rapidity interval size and the average transverse
  momentum of the dijet system. The average number of jets above the veto
  threshold are also shown as a function of the same variables. There are
  two possible selection criteria applied to data. Either the two highest
  transverse momentum jets or the jets most forward and backward in rapidity
  are taken to define the dijet system, where the veto threhsold is 20\;GeV.
  Additionally for the latter selection an alternative veto transverse
  momentum threshold which is equal to the average transverse momentum is
  applied.
  Jet selections are based on the anti-$k_t$ algorithm with $R=0.6$,
  $p_\perp > 20$\;GeV and $|y_\text{jet}| < 4.4$.'
