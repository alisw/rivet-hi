Description:
  'Single and dilepton search for first and second generation scalar leptoquarks by ATLAS at 7 TeV.
  Event counts in four signal regions (single lepton and dilepton for first and second generation) are implemented as one-bin histograms.
  Histograms for event transverse energy are implemented for dilepton signal regions and histograms for leptoquark mass are implemented for single lepton signal regions.
  Histograms for observables in six control regions are implemented.'
