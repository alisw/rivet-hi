Description:
  'Measurements from the ATLAS experiment of the forward-backward asymmetry in the reaction
  $pp \rightarrow Z / \gamma^\ast \rightarrow \ell^+\ell^-$, with $\ell$ being electrons or muons.
  The results are based on the full set of data collected in 2011 in $pp$ collisions at the LHC at
  $\sqrt{s} = 7$~TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.8~$\text{fb}^{-1}$. The measured
  asymmetry values are found to be in agreement with the corresponding Standard Model predictions.
  The default routine will pick up the electron decay channel of the $Z$ boson. Individual channels can
  be specified directly with the plugins ATLAS_2014_I1312627_EL and ATLAS_2014_I1312627_MU, respectively.
  N.B. When running on multiple files, the asymmetry might have to be reconstructed in a post-processing
  step. To that end, the necessary Histo1D objects are written out as well. The asymmetry is a Scatter2D
  objects ending in y01 and is constructed from the Histo1D objects (ending in y02 and y03) in the
  following way: y01 = (y02 - y03) / (y02 + y03)'
