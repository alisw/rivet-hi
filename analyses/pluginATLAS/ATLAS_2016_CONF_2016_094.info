Description:
  'A search for new phenomena in final states characterized by high jet multiplicity,
  an isolated lepton (electron or muon), and either zero or at least three $b$-tagged
  jets is. The search uses 14.8/fb of $\sqrt{s} = 13~\TeV$ proton--proton collision
  data collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider in 2015 and 2016.'
