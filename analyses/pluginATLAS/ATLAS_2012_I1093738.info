Description:
  'A measurement of the production cross section for isolated photons in association with jets
  in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV.
  Photons with $|\eta|<1.37$ and $E_T>25$~GeV and jets with $|y|<4.4$ and $p_T>20$ GeV
  are selected.
  The differential cross section as a function of the photon transverse energy is measured, for
  three leading jet rapidity configurations, separately for the cases where the photon and
  jet rapidities have the same or the opposite sign.
  The measurement uses 37 pb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity collected with the ATLAS detector.'
