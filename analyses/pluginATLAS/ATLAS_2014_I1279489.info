Description:
  'Measurements differential distributions for inclusive $Z$-boson-plus-dijet production are performed
  in five fiducial regions, each with different sensitivity to the electroweak contribution. Measured distributions
  include the differential cross section as a function of the dijet invariant mass, the differential cross section
  and a function of the dijet rapidity separation, the differential cross section as a function of the number of jets
  in the rapidity interval bounded by the two leading jets. Other measurements include the jet veto effiency as a function
  of the dijet invariant mass and rapdity separation, the normalized transverse momentum balance cut efficiency, and the
  average number of jets falling into the rapidity interval boundd by the two leading jets, as a function of dijet invariant
  mass and dijet rapidity separation.'
