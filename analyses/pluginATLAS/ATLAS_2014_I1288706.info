Description:
  Measurements of the differential cross section for the process $Z/\gamma^\ast \rightarrow l$ $(l = e, \mu)$
  as a function of dilepton invariant mass in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7$~TeV.
  The measurement is performed in the $e$ and $\mu$ channels 
  for invariant masses between 26 GeV and 66 GeV in the fiducial region $p_\text{T}^\text{leading} > 15$~GeV,
  $p_\text{T}^\text{subleading} > 12$~GeV, $|\eta| < 2.4$ using an integrated luminosity of 1.6~$\text{fb}^{-1}$. 
  The analysis is extended to invariant masses as low as 12 GeV in the muon channel within a fiducal region of 
  $p_\text{T}^\text{leading} > 9$~GeV, $p_\text{T}^\text{subleading} > 6$~GeV, $|\eta| < 2.4$ with 35~$\text{pb}^{-1}$.
