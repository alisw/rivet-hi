Description:
  'This paper presents measurements of $W^\pm Z$ production in pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The gauge bosons are
  reconstructed using their leptonic decay modes into electrons and muons. The data were collected in 2012 by the ATLAS experiment
  at the Large Hadron Collider and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb${}^{-1}$. The measured inclusive cross section in the
  detector fiducial region is $\sigma(W^\pm Z\to \ell^\prime\nu\ell\ell) = 35.1\pm 0.9$(stat)$\pm 0.8$(sys)$\pm 0.8$(lumi) fb, for one
  leptonic decay channel. In comparison, the next-to-leading-order Standard Model expectation is $30.0\pm 2.1$ fb.
  Cross sections for $W^+ Z$ and $W^- Z$ production and their ratio are presented as well as differential cross sections for several
  kinematic observables. Limits on anomalous triple gauge boson couplings are derived from the transverse mass spectrum of the
  $W^\pm Z$ system. From the analysis of events with a $W$ and a $Z$ boson associated with two or more forward jets an upper limit at
  95% confidence level on the $W^\pm Z$ scattering cross section of 0.63 fb, for each leptonic decay channel, is established,
  while the Standard Model prediction at next-to-leading order is $0.13\pm 0.01$ fb. Limits on anomalous quartic gauge boson couplings
  are also extracted. For distributions that include the infinity symbol ($\infty$) on the horizontal axis, the last bin will
  include the events from the overflow bin. Users should note that explicit matching of lepton flavour between individual SM neutrinos
  and charged leptons is used in this analysis routine, to match the MC-based correction to the fiducial region applied in the paper.
  The data are therefore only valid under the assumption of the Standard Model and cannot be used for BSM reinterpretation.'
