Description:
  Preliminary measurements of the cross section for the production of a $Z$ boson in association with jets in pp collisions at 
  $\sqrt{s} = 13$\,TeV are presented, using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $85\,\text{pb}^{-1}$ collected 
  by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. The cross sections are measured for events containing a $Z$ boson 
  decaying to electrons or muons and produced in association with up to four jets in the kinematical range of 
  $p_\text{T} > 30$\,GeV and $|y| < 2.5$.
