Description:
  'The inclusive and dijet production cross-sections have been
   measured for jets containing $b$-hadrons ($b$-jets) in proton--proton
   collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV, using the
   ATLAS detector at the LHC. The measurements use data corresponding to
   an integrated luminosity of 34 pb$^-1$. The $b$-jets are identified using
   either a lifetime-based method, where secondary decay vertices of
   $b$-hadrons in jets are reconstructed using information from the
   tracking detectors, or a muon-based method where the presence of a
   muon is used to identify semileptonic decays of $b$-hadrons inside
   jets. The inclusive $b$-jet cross-section is measured as a function of
   transverse momentum in the range $20 < pT < 400$ GeV and rapidity in the
   range $|y| < 2.1$. The $b\bar{b}$-dijet cross-section is measured as a
   function of the dijet invariant mass in the range $110 < $m_{jj}$ < 760$\;GeV,
   the azimuthal angle difference between the two jets and the
   angular variable $\chi$ in two dijet mass regions. The results are
   compared with next-to-leading-order QCD predictions. Good agreement is
   observed between the measured cross-sections and the predictions
   obtained using POWHEG+Pythia6. MC@NLO+Herwig shows good agreement
   with the measured $b\bar{b}$-dijet cross-section. However, it does not
   reproduce the measured inclusive cross-section well, particularly for
   central $b$-jets with large transverse momenta.'
