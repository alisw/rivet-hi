Description:
  The momentum-weighted sum of the charges of tracks associated to a jet is sensitive to the charge of the initiating quark or
  gluon. This paper presents a measurement of the distribution of momentum-weighted sums, called jet charge, in dijet events using
  20.3 fb${}^{-1}$ of data recorded with the ATLAS detector at $\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV in $pp$ collisions at the LHC. The jet charge 
  distribution is unfolded to remove distortions from detector effects and the resulting particle-level distribution is compared with 
  several models. The $p_\text{T}$ dependence of the jet charge distribution average and standard deviation are compared to 
  predictions obtained with several leading-order and next-to-leading-order parton distribution functions. The data are also compared 
  to different Monte Carlo simulations of QCD dijet production using various settings of the free parameters within these models. 
  The chosen value of the strong coupling constant used to calculate gluon radiation is found to have a significant impact on the predicted 
  jet charge. There is evidence for a $p_\text{T}$ dependence of the jet charge distribution for a given jet flavor. In agreement with 
  perturbative QCD predictions, the data show that the average jet charge of quark-initiated jets decreases in magnitude as the energy 
  of the jet increases.
