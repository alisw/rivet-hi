Description:
  A measurement of the cross section for the inclusive production of isolated prompt photons in proton-proton collisions at a
  centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 8$~TeV is presented. The measurement covers the pseudorapidity ranges $|\eta^\gamma| < 1.37$
  $1.56 < |\eta^\gamma| < 2.37$ in the transverse energy range $25 < E^\gamma_\text{T} < 1500$~GeV. The results are based on an
  integrated luminosity of 20.2~fb${}^{-1}$, recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Photon candidates are identified by combining
  information from the calorimeters and the inner tracker. The background is subtracted using a data-driven technique, based on the
  observed calorimeter shower-shape variables and the deposition of hadronic energy in a narrow cone around the photon candidate.
