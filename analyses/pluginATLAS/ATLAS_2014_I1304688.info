RunInfo:
  ttbar events with at least one lepton in the ttbar final state at 7 TeV, i.e. both semileptonic and dileptonic decays should be enabled. The tau decay channels also count as leptonic.

Description:
 'Measurement of the differential t$\bar{\mathrm t}$ production
 cross-section in 7 TeV proton-proton collisions in the single-lepton
 channel from ATLAS. The data comprise the full 2011 data sample corresponding to an
 integrated luminosity of $4.6\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. The differential cross-sections are
 measured as a function of the jet multiplicity for up to eight jets using jet transverse
 momentum thresholds of 25, 40, 60, and 80 GeV, and as a function of jet transverse
 momentum up to the fifth leading jet. The results after background subtraction are corrected
 for all detector effects, within a kinematic range closely matched to the experimental
 acceptance.'
