Description:
  'A search for new phenomena in final states with an energetic jet and large missing
  transverse momentum. The search uses proton-proton collision data corresponding to
  an integrated luminosity of 3.2/fb of $pp$ collisions at 13\;\TeV, collected in 2015
  with the ATLAS detector. Events are required to have at least one jet with a
  transverse momentum above 250 GeV and no leptons. Several signal regions are considered
  with increasing missing-transverse-momentum requirements between $E_T^\mathrm{miss} >
  250\;\GeV$ and 700\;\GeV. Good agreement is observed between the number of events
  in data and Standard Model predictions.'
