Description:
  'A measurement of the differential cross-section for the inclusive
  production of isolated prompt photons in $pp$ collisions at a
  center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV is presented. The measurement
  covers the pseudorapidity ranges $|\eta|<1.37$ and $1.52<|\eta|<2.37$ in
  the transverse energy range $45<E_T<400$ GeV. The results are based on
  an integrated luminosity of 35 pb$^{-1}$, collected with the ATLAS detector
  at the LHC. The yields of the signal photons are measured using a
  data-driven technique, based on the observed distribution of the
  hadronic energy in a narrow cone around the photon candidate and the
  photon selection criteria. The results are compared with
  next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculations and found to be in
  good agreement over four orders of magnitude in cross-section.'
