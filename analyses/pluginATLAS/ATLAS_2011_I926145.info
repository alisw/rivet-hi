Description:
  'Measurement of inclusive electron and muon cross sections for
  $7 < \pT <26$~GeV in  $|\eta| <2.0$, excluding $1.37<|\eta|<1.52$,
  and muon cross section for $4 < \pT < 100$~GeV in  $|\eta| <2.50$.
  The $W/Z/\gamma^*$ component must be subtracted to leave the heavy flavour
  contribution.'
