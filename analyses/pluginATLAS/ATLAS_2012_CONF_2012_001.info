Description:
  'Search for SUSY using events with 4 or more leptons in association with
   missing transverse energy in proton-proton
   collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. The data sample has a total
   integrated luminosity of 2.06 fb$^{-1}$. There is no reference data and
   in addition to the control plots from the paper the number of events in
   the two signal regions,
   correctly normalized to an integrated luminosity 2.06 fb$^{-1}$,
   are calculated.'
