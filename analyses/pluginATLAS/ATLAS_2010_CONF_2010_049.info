Description:
  Jets are identified and their properties studied using tracks measured by the
  ATLAS Inner Detector. Events are selected using a minimum-bias trigger,
  allowing the emergence of jets at low transverse momentum to be observed and
  for jets to be studied independently of the calorimeter. Jets are
  reconstructed using the anti-kt algorithm applied to tracks with two
  parameter choices, 0.4 and 0.6. An inclusive jet transverse momentum cross
  section measurement from 4 GeV to 80 GeV is shown, integrated over
  $|\eta| < 0.57$ and corrected to charged particle-level truth jets. The
  probability that a particular particle carries a fixed fraction of the jet
  momentum (fragmentation function) is also measured.
  All data is corrected to the particle level. ATTENTION - Data read from plots!
