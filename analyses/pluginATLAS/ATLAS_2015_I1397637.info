Description:
  The differential cross-section for pair production of top quarks with high transverse momentum is measured in 20.3fb${}^{-1}$ of
  proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8~TeV. The measurement is performed for $t\bar{t}$ events in the lepton+jets
  channel. The cross-section is reported as a function of the hadronically decaying top quark transverse momentum for values above
  300~GeV. The hadronically decaying top quark is reconstructed as an anti-$k_\text{t}$ jet with radius parameter $R=1.0$ and
  identified with jet substructure techniques. The observed yield is corrected for detector effects to obtain a cross-section at
  particle level in a fiducial region close to the event selection.
