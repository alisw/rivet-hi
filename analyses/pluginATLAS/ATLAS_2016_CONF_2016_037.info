Description:
  'A search for strongly produced supersymmetric particles using signatures
   involving multiple energetic jets and either two isolated same-sign leptons
   ($e$ or $\mu$) or at least three isolated leptons. The analysis also utilises
   other observables, such as $b$-tagged jets or missing transverse momentum,
   to extend its sensitivity. A data sample of proton--proton collisions at
   $\sqrt{s} = 13~\TeV$ recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider
   in 2015 and 2016, corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 13.2/fb,
   is used for the search. No significant excess over the Standard Model
   expectation is observed.'
