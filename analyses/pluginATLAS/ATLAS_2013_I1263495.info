Description:
  'A measurement of the cross section for the production of isolated prompt photons
   in pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy $sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV is presented.
   The results are based on an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb$^{-1}$ collected with
   the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The cross section is measured as a function of photon
   pseudorapidity $\eta^\gamma$ and transverse energy $E_T^\gamma$ in the
   kinematic range $100 < E_T^\gamma < 1000$ GeV and in the regions
   $|\eta^\gamma| < 1.37$ and $1.52 < |\eta^\gamma| < 2.37$. The results are
   compared to leading-order parton-shower Monte Carlo models and next-to-leading
   order perturbative QCD calculations. Next to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculations
   agree well with the measured cross sections as a function of $E_T^\gamma$ and $\eta^\gamma$.'
