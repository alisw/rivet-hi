Description:
     'This paper describes a measurement of the inclusive top quark pair production cross-section ($\sigma_{t\bar{t}}$) with a data
     sample of 3.2~fb${}^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV, collected in 2015 by the
     ATLAS detector at the LHC. This measurement uses events with an opposite-charge electron-muon pair in the final state. Jets
     containing $b$-quarks are tagged using an algorithm based on track impact parameters and reconstructed secondary vertices. The
     numbers of events with exactly one and exactly two $b$-tagged jets are counted and used to determine simultaneously
     $\sigma_{t\bar{t}}$ and the efficiency to reconstruct and $b$-tag a jet from a top quark decay, thereby minimising the associated
     systematic uncertainties. The cross-section is measured to be: $\sigma_{t\bar{t}} = 818 \pm 8$ (stat) $\pm 27$ (syst) $\pm 19$
     (lumi) $\pm 12$ (beam) pb, where the four uncertainties arise from data statistics, experimental and theoretical systematic effects,
     the integrated luminosity and the LHC beam energy, giving a total relative uncertainty of 4.4\%. The result is consistent with
     theoretical QCD calculations at next-to-next-to-leading order. A fiducial measurement corresponding to the experimental acceptance
     of the leptons is also presented.'
