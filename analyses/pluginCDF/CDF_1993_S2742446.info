RunInfo:
  All prompt photon production processes in $p \bar{p}$ at 1800 GeV.
  Hadronisation should be switched off, because non-prompt photon production
  has been corrected for.

Description:
  Data taken with the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) during the 1988-1989
  run of the Tevatron are used to measure the distribution of the center-of-mass
  (rest frame of the initial state partons) angle between isolated prompt
  photons and the beam direction. 
  WARNING --- Implemented is the simplified c.m. definition
  given in the paper. The rise of the data and the MC predictions presented in the 
  latter could not be reproduced.
