RunInfo:
  Requires $2\rightarrow{2}$ QCD scattering processes. The minimum jet
  $E_\perp$ is 62 GeV, so a cut on kinematic pTmin may be required for
  good statistics.

Description:
  Measurement of the inclusive jet cross section in $p\bar{p}$
  collisions at $\sqrt{s}=1.96$ TeV as a function of jet $E_\perp$, for $E_\perp >$
  62 GeV. The data is collected by the CDF II detector and has an
  integrated luminosity of 1.13 fb$^{-1}$. The measurement was made
  using the cone-based Midpoint jet clustering algorithm in rapidity
  bins within $|y|<2.1$. This measurement can be used to provide
  increased precision in PDFs at high parton momentum fraction $x$.
