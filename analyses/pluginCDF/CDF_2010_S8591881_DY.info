Description:
  Deepak Kar and Rick Field's measurement of the underlying event in
  Drell-Yan events. $Z -> ee$ and $Z -> \mu\mu$ events are selected using
  a $Z$ mass window cut between 70 and 110~GeV. ``Toward'', ``away'' and
  ``transverse'' regions are defined in the same way as in the original
  (2001) CDF underlying event analysis. The reconstructed $Z$ defines the
  $\phi$ direction of the toward region. The leptons are ignored after
  the $Z$ has been reconstructed. Thus the region most sensitive to the
  underlying event is the toward region (the recoil jet is boosted into
  the away region).
