Description:
  "Niccolo Moggi's min bias analysis. Minimum bias events are used to
  measure the charged multiplicity distribution. The multiplicity
  distribution was not published in S8233977 but the numbers and a
  public note are available from the CDF website given above.
  Note: the systematic and statistical errors in Rivet were added
  in quadrature."
