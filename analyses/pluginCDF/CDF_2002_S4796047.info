Description:
  A study of $p\bar{p}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 1800$ and 630 GeV collected
  using a minimum bias trigger in which the data set is divided into two
  classes corresponding to `soft' and `hard' interactions. For each
  subsample, the analysis includes measurements of the multiplicity,
  transverse momentum (pT) spectra, and the average pT and event-by-event
  pT dispersion as a function of multiplicity. A comparison of
  results shows distinct differences in the behavior of the two samples
  as a function of the center of mass energy. The properties of the soft
  sample are invariant as a function of c.m. energy.

  It should be noticed that minimum bias tunings of PYTHIA made by ATLAS
  in early 2010, which used this among all other available data from CDF
  and from ATLAS at 900~GeV and 7~TeV, found an unavoidable tension between
  this data and the rest. Accordingly, this data was excluded from the fits.
  Whether this reflects a problem with this dataset or with the PYTHIA MPI
  model is a judgement for users to make!
