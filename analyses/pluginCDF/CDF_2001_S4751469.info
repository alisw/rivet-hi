RunInfo:
  $p\bar{p}$ QCD interactions at 1800 GeV. The leading jet is binned from
  0--49 GeV, and histos can usually can be filled with a single generator
  run without kinematic sub-samples.

Description:
  The original CDF underlying event analysis, based on decomposing each
  event into a transverse structure with ``toward'', ``away'' and
  ``transverse'' regions defined relative to the azimuthal direction of
  the leading jet in the event. Since the toward region is by definition
  dominated by the hard process, as is the away region by momentum
  balance in the matrix element, the transverse region is most sensitive
  to multi-parton interactions. The transverse regions occupy $|\phi|
  \in [60\degree, 120\degree]$ for $|\eta| < 1$. The $\pT$ ranges for the
  leading jet are divided experimentally into the `min-bias' sample from
  0--20 GeV, and the `JET20' sample from 18--49 GeV.
