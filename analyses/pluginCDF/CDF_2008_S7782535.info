RunInfo:
  Requires $2 \rightarrow 2$ QCD scattering processes. The minimum jet $E_\perp$ is 52\;GeV,
  so kinematic cuts on pTmin may be required for statistical validity.

Description:
  A measurement of the shapes of $b$-jets using 300 pb$^{-1}$ of data
  obtained with CDF II in $p\bar{p}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=1.96$ TeV.
  The measured quantity is the average integrated jet shape, which is
  computed over an ensemble of jets. This quantity is expressed as
  $\Psi(r/R) = \langle\frac{p_\perp(0 \rightarrow r)}{p_\perp(0 \rightarrow
  R)}\rangle$, where $p_\perp(0 \rightarrow r)$ is the scalar sum of the
  transverse momenta of all objects inside a sub-cone of radius $r$ around
  the jet axis. The integrated shapes are by definition normalized such
  that  $\Psi(r/R =1) = 1$.   The measurement is done in bins of jet pT
  in the range 52 to 300\;GeV/$c$. The jets have $|\eta| < 0.7$. The $b$-jets
  are expected to be broader than inclusive jets. Moreover, $b$-jets
  containing a single $b$-quark are expected to be narrower than those
  containing a $b \bar{b}$ pair from gluon splitting.
