RunInfo:
  QCD events at $\sqrt{s} = 630$ \& 1800 GeV.
  Several $\pT^\text{min}$ cutoffs are probably required to fill the
  profile histograms, e.g. 0 (min bias), 30, 90, 150 GeV at 1800 GeV,
  and 0 (min bias), 20, 90, 150 GeV at 630 GeV.
NumEvents: 1000000
Beams: [p-, p+]
Energies: [630, 1800]
PtCuts: [0, 30, 90, 150] # for 1800, [0, 20, 90, 150] for 630
Description:
  This analysis studies the underlying event via transverse cones of
  $R = 0.7$ at 90 degrees in \phi relative to the leading (highest E) jet,
  at $\sqrt{s} = 630$ and 1800 GeV. This is similar to the 2001 CDF UE
  analysis, except that cones, rather than the whole central \eta range
  are used. The transverse cones are categorised as `TransMIN' and
  `TransMAX' on an event-by-event basis, to give greater sensitivity to
  the UE component.

  `Swiss Cheese' distributions, where cones around
  the leading $n$ jets are excluded from the distributions, are also
  included for $n = 2, 3$.  This analysis is useful for constraining the
  energy evolution of the underlying event, since it performs the same
  analyses at two distinct CoM energies.

  WARNING! The pT plots are normalised to raw number of events. The min bias
  data have not been reproduced by MC, and are not recommended for tuning.
