Description:
  In this analysis the behavior of the underlying event in hard scattering
  proton-antiproton collisions at 300 GeV, 900 GeV, and 1.96 TeV is studied.
  The 300 GeV and 900 GeV data are a result of the Tevatron Energy Scan
  which was performed just before the Tevatron was shut down. The energy
  ratio histograms can be created from different runs with a merging script
  available in the Rivet bin directory.
