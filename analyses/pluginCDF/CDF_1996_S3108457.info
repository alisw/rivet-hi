RunInfo:
  Pure QCD events without underlying event (the paper states that UE was
  corrected for).
  Several runs with different kinematic cuts might be needed to fill the 
  2,3,4,5 and 6-jet properly.
NumEvents: 1000000
Beams: [p-, p+]

PtCuts: [20]
Description:
  Properties of two-, three-, four-, five-, and six-jet events...
  Multijet-mass, leading jet angle, jet pT.
NeedCrossSection: yes
ToDo:
 - This is at 1800 GeV only, or also 630 GeV?
