Description:
  CDF Run I color coherence analysis. Events with $\ge 3$ jets are
  selected and Et distributions of the three highest-pT jets are
  obtained. The plotted quantities are the $\Delta{R}$ between the 2nd
  and 3rd leading jets in the pT and pseudorapidity of the 3rd jet, and
  $\alpha = \mathrm{d}{\eta}/\mathrm{d}{\phi}$, where $\mathrm{d}{\eta}$
  is the pseudorapidity difference between the 2nd and 3rd jets and
  $\mathrm{d}{\phi}$ is their azimuthal angle difference.  Since the
  data has not been detector-corrected, a bin by bin correction is
  applied, based on the distributions with ideal and CDF simulation as
  given in the publication.
