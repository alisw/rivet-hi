  /// @brief The projection handler is a central repository for projections to be used
  /// in a Rivet analysis run.
  ///
  /// Without centralised projections, it can be hard to know which of an
  /// equivalent set of projections will be run on a particular event. In turn,
  /// this may mean that certain projections in the chain can go out of scope
  /// unexpectedly. There were originally also the issues that projections may
  /// need to be held as member pointers to an abstract base class, since
  /// post-construction setup is needed; that projections contained pointers to
  /// their own dependency chain, which could go out of scope; and that
  /// projection members could be modified after being applied to an event
  /// which, due to the caching model, would have unpredictable consequences.
  ///
  /// By centralising all the projections, these issues are eliminated, as well
  /// as allowing analysis classes to contain fewer data members (since
  /// projections are now better accessed by name than by storing a data member
  /// reference or pointer).
  ///
  /// The core of the ProjectionHandler design is that it is a singleton class,
  /// essentially a wrapper around a map of @c Projection*, indexed by a hash of
  /// the registering object and its local name for the registered projection.
